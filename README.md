# JComp-Windows

## Introduction
This is the windows version of the Java Compiler system (JComp)

The "Java Compiler System" or "JComp" System was developed to make Java programming slightly easier. 
As long as you have the JDK installed you can take full advantage of the JComp system.
JComp was developed to to make the mundane tasks of java programming and maker everything slightly easier!
From a simple compiler and executor, to a backup system with full restoration and ".class" file cleanups.

JComp was intended initilise and execute java projects. While limited in certain aspects there are soon to be many changes.
From an independant developer I wish to make many java programmmers lives easier. 

Any recomendations for updates can be commented and will be looked at without careful consideration.
Any update that wasn't being considered, yet suggested will be given credit for.

Please do enjoy the luxury of JComp for windows!
